Half subtractor

"A half subtractor is a digital logic circuit that performs the binary subtraction of two single-bit binary numbers. It has two inputs, A and B, and two outputs, Difference and Borrow. The Difference output represents the result of subtracting B from A, while the Borrow output indicates whether a borrow is needed when A is smaller than B."

Full subtractor

"A Full Subtractor is a combinational circuit used to perform binary subtraction. It has three inputs:

A (Minuend)
B (Subtrahend)
B-IN (Borrow-in from the previous stage)
It produces two outputs:

Difference (D): The result of the subtraction.
Borrow-out (B-OUT): Indicates if a borrow is needed for the next stage.
The full subtractor is essential because a half-subtractor can only subtract the least significant bit (LSB) of binary numbers. However, if a borrow is generated during the subtraction of the LSBs, it will affect the subtraction in the next stages. A full subtractor handles this situation by considering the borrow from the previous stage, ensuring accurate subtraction even when a borrow is present.

The full subtractor is used to subtract binary numbers with borrow handling, making it suitable for multi-bit subtraction in digital circuits like Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs). "
