Half Adder

"A half adder is a basic combinational circuit that adds two single-bit binary inputs (A and B) to produce a SUM using an XOR gate and a CARRY using an AND gate, without considering any carry-in from a previous stage.

Performs binary addition of two 1-bit inputs, generating a SUM (A ⊕ B) and CARRY (A · B).
Cannot handle carry-in from a previous stage, making it suitable only for the first stage of multi-bit addition."

Full Adder

"Full Adder is a combinational circuit that adds three inputs and produces two outputs. The first two inputs are A and B and the third input is an input carry as C-IN. The output carry is designated as C-OUT and the normal output is designated as S which is SUM.

The C-OUT is also known as the majority 1's detector, whose output goes high when more than one input is high.
A full adder logic is designed in such a manner that can take eight inputs together to create a byte-wide adder and cascade the carry bit from one adder to another.
We use a full adder because when a carry-in bit is available, another 1-bit adder must be used since a 1-bit half-adder does not take a carry-in bit.
A 1-bit full adder adds three operands and generates 2-bit results.
Full Adder Truth Table
A Full Adder takes three binary inputs:

A (first bit)
B (second bit)
C-IN (carry input)
And it produces two outputs:

Sum (S)
Carry Out (C-OUT)"
